## Features

### Preview

In the card preview area, you can modify the card text (fighter score, level, variant name, and fighter name).

You can also move, scale, and rotate your uploaded image by interacting with the card background.

Clicking on the top, left, right, or bottom area of the card will activate a mask that crops out the parts of your uploaded image which lie beyond the top, left, right, or bottom edge of the card.

### Basic Options

You can choose the tier, element, and energy type of the card and you can upload an image to use as card art.

With your uploaded image, you have the option to edit it using the text inputs or by selecting the move, scale, or rotate tool and then interacting with the card preview area.

You can also specify whether the image should overlap the top border of the card.

### Custom Gradients

The custom gradients allow you to override the default colors specified by tier and element from basic options.

You have the option to select one of the familiar presets, or you can make your own gradient.

You own gradient must follow follow the format of a list of `(color name or color number) (brightness percentage)` separated by commas.
